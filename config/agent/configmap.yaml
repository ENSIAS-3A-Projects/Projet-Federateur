data:
  # SamplingInterval is how often we sample kernel signals.
  # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "1s", "500ms", "2m")
  samplingInterval: "1s"

  # WriteInterval is how often we write PodAllocation updates to the API.
  # Format: Go duration string
  # Increased from 5s to 10s to reduce churn while maintaining efficiency
  writeInterval: "10s"

  # MinChangePercent is the minimum change required to write an update (hysteresis).
  # Value: 0.0 to 100.0 (percentage)
  # Increased from 2.0% to 5.0% to require larger changes before applying (reduces churn)
  minChangePercent: "5.0"

  # SystemReservePercent is the percentage of node CPU to reserve for system.
  # Value: 0.0 to 100.0 (percentage)
  systemReservePercent: "10.0"

  # BaselineCPUPerPod is the minimum CPU to allocate per pod.
  # Format: Kubernetes resource quantity (e.g., "100m", "500m", "1")
  baselineCPUPerPod: "100m"

  # StartupGracePeriod is the duration after startup during which
  # allocations are only allowed to increase, not decrease.
  # Format: Go duration string
  startupGracePeriod: "45s"

  # SLOTargetLatencyMs is the target p99 latency for SLO scoring (0 = disabled).
  # Used for utility-based allocation.
  # Value: milliseconds (e.g., "500" for 500ms)
  sloTargetLatencyMs: "0"

  # PrometheusURL is the URL for Prometheus API (empty = disabled).
  # Used for querying latency metrics for SLO scoring.
  # Example: "http://prometheus:9090"
  prometheusURL: ""

  # FastLoopInterval is the interval for the fast SLO guardrail loop (1-2s).
  # This loop responds quickly to SLO violations and throttling pressure.
  # Format: Go duration string
  fastLoopInterval: "2s"

  # SlowLoopInterval is the interval for the slow economic optimizer loop (5-15s).
  # This loop runs market clearing and optimization.
  # Format: Go duration string
  # Increased from 10s to 15s to reduce optimization frequency (reduces churn)
  slowLoopInterval: "15s"

  # P99ThresholdMultiplier is the multiplier for p99 latency threshold.
  # Fast loop triggers when p99 > target * P99ThresholdMultiplier.
  # Value: > 0.0 (e.g., "1.2" means 20% above target)
  p99ThresholdMultiplier: "1.2"

  # ThrottlingThreshold is the throttling ratio threshold (0-1).
  # Fast loop triggers when throttling ratio > ThrottlingThreshold.
  # Value: 0.0 to 1.0 (e.g., "0.1" means 10% throttling)
  throttlingThreshold: "0.1"

  # FastStepSizeMin is the minimum fast-up step size (0-1).
  # When fast loop triggers, allocation increases by at least this percentage.
  # Value: 0.0 to 1.0 (e.g., "0.20" means 20% minimum increase)
  fastStepSizeMin: "0.20"

  # FastStepSizeMax is the maximum fast-up step size (0-1).
  # When fast loop triggers, allocation increases by at most this percentage.
  # Value: 0.0 to 1.0 (e.g., "0.40" means 40% maximum increase)
  fastStepSizeMax: "0.40"

  # AllocationMechanism selects the market clearing mechanism.
  # Options: "nash" (Nash Bargaining, default) or "primal-dual" (Distributed Primal-Dual)
  allocationMechanism: "nash"

  # EnableKalmanPrediction enables Kalman filter for demand prediction.
  # Value: "true" or "false"
  enableKalmanPrediction: "true"

  # EnableBatchReconciliation enables batch reconciliation of multiple PodAllocations.
  # Value: "true" or "false"
  enableBatchReconciliation: "true"

  # CoalitionGroupingAnnotation is the annotation key for coalition grouping.
  # Pods with the same annotation value are grouped for joint optimization.
  coalitionGroupingAnnotation: "mbcas.io/coalition"

  # TotalClusterCPUCapacityMilli is the total CPU capacity available for allocation in millicores.
  # This is a fixed value defined by the user to avoid relying on node capacity reporting (which can be buggy in minikube).
  # Should match the actual CPU available in the cluster (e.g., "4000" for 4 cores).
  # Default: 4000m (4 cores)
  totalClusterCPUCapacityMilli: "4000"
